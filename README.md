Optimal Feedback Control for Simplified Leg Model

- To model human motor behavior and experimentally determine the means by which humans “optimally” control themselves while taking advantage of the inherent nonlinear and variable outcomes produced by muscles and joints.
- Motor synergies, task-constrained variability (aka the uncontrolled manifold), repeat-ability of task goal achievement without reducing in path trajectory variance all become emergent properties of this underlying control framework.
- MATLAB Code
